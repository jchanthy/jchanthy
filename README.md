## About Me

Hello! I'm Chanthy John, a Web Developer working at CADT (Cambodia Academy of Digital Technology). My current responsibilities include managing the e-learning platform and teaching Basic Computer and Computer Essentials at IDG (Institute of Digital Governance), which operates under CADT.

I'm also on a learning journey to become a Full Stack Developer through a program sponsored by MPTC (Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Cambodia). Additionally, I've been pursuing a Master's degree in Science Information Systems at UP (University of Putisastra) since 2019.

My passion lies in continuously learning new technologies and sharing that knowledge with the younger generation. Apart from my professional endeavors, I maintain a YouTube channel called "ReanDigital,". You can also find me on Facebook with the page name "áž…áž“ áž…áž“áŸ’áž’áž¸ - John Chanthy."
